\chapter{Conclusions}

With this project we have an overview of emotions expressed in Wikipedia discussions, but much more can be done. With the help of other team members, we plan to join our metrics and generate a better representation of an editor's life cycle. Future work on emotions can also be done. We want to implement other emotion lexicon, such as LIWC, to have a comparison with other system, and use information from other team members to better define users' group.

The current dashboard is a bare-bone version of what we have in mind. We want to keep improving it, joining metrics from different projects and giving users greater freedom on the choice of data thy want to visualize.

All the information we gather will soon be outdated. For this reason we are implementing a system that automatically updates our metrics with the latest Wikipedia dump. We also plan to extend this analysis to other languages.

All the code wrote, is public and was made to be modular, giving the possibility to others to continue this work.
