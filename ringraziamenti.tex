\emph{
  This project was possible only thanks to people truly interested in the topic, who guided and helped me in the past months. A special thanks goes to Cristian Consonni and David Laniado, who followed my progress with interest and are always available to help. They always went a step further than what they were asked. I also want to thanks all the other students in our team, which whom I collaborated in the most pleasant way. Finally, I want to thanks professor Alberto Montresor, who introduced me to this project and was always available and interested in my progress.
